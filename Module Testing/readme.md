# Arduino Home Monitor - Module Testing
### By: Sergio Escuder

## ArduinoHomeMonitor Module Examples
This section goes through all the main components required to put an ArduinoHomeMonitor fully working.
The objective is to get familiar with all the code involved in each of the components in order to have a better undestanding when dealing with the whole project.
It also makes sure that once the hardware is connected together, all modules are working correctely in a separate way, increasing the chances of everything working together as modules interact with each other in the whole project firmware.
It is therefore, highly recommended to work through all of this examples and make sure you understand each line of code involved in each program. Each module has one or several example codes which have been reduced to contain only the code which is profitable to gain an understanding of how it operates.

The order in which this modules appear listed here has been stablished in order to allow a profitable step by step learning curve. This means learning things like LCDs on the first step allows to be able to integrate LCD screen in the learning curve whenever neccesary. This also allows you to create your own example programs to test you have fully understud how things work.
