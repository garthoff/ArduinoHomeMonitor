## ArduinoHomeMonitor Modules Examples
The EmonTx code guide goes through main components required to put a full emontx firmware together. It's recommended that you work through these examples first so that you have a good understanding of how the full firmware's work.
The order in which this modules appear listed here has been stablished in order to allow a profitable step by step learning curve. This means learning things like LCDs on the first step allows to be able to integrate LCD screen in the learning curve whenever neccesary.
