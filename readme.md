# EmonTx - Wireless energy-monitoring node 

Main EmonTx page: 
http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/emontx

Builds on JeeLabs software and compatible with JeeNode hardware

## Libraries Needed
* RFM12: http://github.com/jcw/jeelib
* Mains Voltage and current: https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonLib
* Temperature control library: http://download.milesburton.com/Arduino/MaximTemperature/ (version 372 works with Arduino 1.0) and OneWire library: http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html
* ElsterMeterReader: https://github.com/openenergymonitor/ElsterMeterReader

## EmonTx Code guide
The EmonTx code guide goes through main components required to put a full emontx firmware together. It's recommended that you work through these examples first so that you have a good understanding of how the full firmware's work.
* [01 - Single CT](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/blob/master/Guide/a_SingleCT/a_SingleCT.ino)
* [02 - Second CT](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/blob/master/Guide/b_SecondCT/b_SecondCT.ino)
* [03 - AC Voltage](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/blob/master/Guide/c_ACVoltage/c_ACVoltage.ino)
* [04 - Temperature](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/blob/master/Guide/d_Temperature/d_Temperature.ino)
* [05 - Pulse Counting](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/blob/master/Guide/e_PulseCounting/e_PulseCounting.ino)
* [06 - Elster Meter](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/blob/master/Guide/f_ElsterMeter/f_ElsterMeter.ino)
* [07 - Transmitting Data](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/blob/master/Guide/g_TransmittingData/g_TransmittingData.ino)
* [08 - Watchdog](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/blob/master/Guide/h_watchdog/h_watchdog.ino)

## Full EmonTx Firmware's
* **emonTx_CT123** - Apparent Power Example - Use this example if only using CT sensors. Monitors AC current using one CT sensor and transmit data via wireless using RFM12B to emonBase. 

* **emonTx_CT123_Voltage** - Real Power - Use this example if using an AC-AC adapter with as well as CT sensors. AC-AC plug-in adapter to monitors AC RMS voltage and give real power and current direction readings. 

* **emonTx_Pulse** - Use for counting pulses from pulse output utility meter (flashing LED). Optical sensor can be used to detect pulses. 

* **emonTx_Temperature** - For using multiple DS18B20 temperature sensors on a one-wire bus with emonTx. Uses direct addressing method, run the 'temperature search' sketch to find the addresses of the DS18B20 sensors and insert into main example. http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/buildingblocks/DS18B20-temperature-sensing

**Note:** CT must be clipped round either the Live or Neutral wire, not both! 

When the example has been successfully uploaded the green LED should blink quickly once very 10's
