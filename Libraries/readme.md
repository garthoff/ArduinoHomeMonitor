## Libraries Needed
Here is a list of all the libraries used along the project. All this libraries have been found on the internet, none of them are created by me so hopefully the creators have left some information in their files stating this. All I want to do is help by providing a simple list of libraries which have been tested in Arduino 1.0.1 and are fully working as well as adding some interesting examples.
